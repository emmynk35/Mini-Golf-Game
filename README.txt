MINI GOLF
BY ALEX LI AND EMMY KHAWSAM-ANG

Please open the game through Level 1 in the Unity Editor.

Get the golf ball in the hole in as few moves as possible! Click and drag to hit the ball. Grey shapes are obstacles and the ball will bounce. Blue shapes are water and if you reach the water, you will go back to your original position. The yellow shapes are sand and will slow down your ball. The black circle is the hole in which you are trying to get the ball in. Balls will bounce off of walls.
